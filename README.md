# Credit-scoring-p2p-lending
This project is a walkthough of an exploratory analysis I made on a dataset related to Peer-to-Peer transactions of a famous European platform. The task was to identify a customer segment that would beat (return-wise) a self-imposed benchmark.

Please notice that it was not required to find "the best" investment target.

Also, the walkthough of the analysis is achieved through Screenshots, which although are not as visually appealing as some fancy PowerPoint slides would have, they offer a good trade-off in terms of commitment over result.
