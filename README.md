# portfolio-optimisation
This project has the purpose of automatically optimising (through VBA and Solver) an investment portfolio by looking at historical returns of self-selected traded stocks, whose data are scraped from Yahoo Finance. Three objective functions for the optimisation have been set: 

1- Expected return maximisation

2- Beta minimisation

3- Beta minimisation while achieving a return >80% of maximum return
